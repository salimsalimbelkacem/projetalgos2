# s2 algo project from bikriiiiiii

hello liza (and racha) euhhh that is the cryto part the only part you have to do, i don't exactly remember what happens in the program, and i kinda lost the report and the presentation, idk if it's the time to ask anes for them tbh with the intership and pfe but whatever. i hope you'll understand the code, it is prety terrible, the keygen and decrypting part looks confusing idk how to explain it but euhh yeah

maybe you can ask yasser for our report and presentation

and i think the steps are different anyway, we had to guess what to do, we didn't have clear steps but only uncoherent blob of texts (boohoo) :(

there's a lot of things that can be optimized like a lot of things, i don't have the energy to look them all up, but whatever 

i wish you the best and i love you <3 (liza)
